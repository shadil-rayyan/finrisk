BOTTOM LINE

RISK BREAKDOWN
  🔴 Critical — act this week:   {len(critical)} {'vulnerability' if len(critical)==1 else 'vulnerabilities'}
  🟠 High — act this sprint:     {len(high)} {'vulnerability' if len(high)==1 else 'vulnerabilities'}
  🟡 Medium / Low — schedule:    {len(other)} {'vulnerability' if len(other)==1 else 'vulnerabilities'}

TOP 3 RISKS BY FINANCIAL EXPOSURE
{top3}{chain_block}
WHAT HAPPENS IF WE DO NOTHING
  Based on breach rates for {company.industry} companies our size, at least one
  of these vulnerabilities is likely to be found and exploited within
  6–18 months if unaddressed.

WHAT WE ARE ASKING FOR
  Approval to allocate {total_hours:.0f} engineering hours to address
  the {len(critical)} critical and {len(high)} high-priority vulnerabilities.
  Estimated cost: {fmt(total_fix_cost)}.
